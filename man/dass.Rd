\details{
The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) is a self-report
instrument for measuring depression, anxiety, and tension or stress. 
Each of 42 items falls into one of the three corresponding subscales.

Labels for DASS items in this dataset are denoted by the prefix 
"dass" and the suffix "_D", "_A", or "_S", indicating the depression,
anxiety, or stress subscale.

Also includes demographics such as country, education level, 
rearing environment (urban/suburban/rural), gender, 
English as a native language, age, religion, sexual orientation, 
race, voting status, marriage status, and number of children 
in one's family during childhood.
