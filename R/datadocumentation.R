#' Ten Item Personality Questionnaire
#'
#' This dataset includes 1899 online participants who participated
#' in a questionnaire available through the Open Source Psychometrics
#' Project (https://openpsychometrics.org/), an organization that maintains an 
#' open website for the public to take psychometric tests for 
#' educational and entertainment purposes
#' 
#' The Ten Item Personality Questionnaire (TIPI) is a brief inventory of the Big 
#' Five personality domains. Each personality domain is assessed with two 
#' items. One item measures the domain normally and the other item measures 
#' the domain in reverse (e.g., "reserved, quiet" for reverse extraversion).
#' 
#' Labels for TIPI items in this dataset correspond to the first letter of 
#' each Big Five personality domain (Extraversion, Neuroticism, 
#' Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Openness to experience), 
#' with the character ``r'' indicating items that measure the domain 
#' in reverse.
#' 
#' Also includes demographics such as education level, 
#' rearing environment (urban/suburban/rural), gender, 
#' English as a native language, age, religion, sexual orientation, 
#' race, voting status, marriage status, and number of children 
#' in one's family during childhood.

#' Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale
#'
#' This dataset includes a randomly selected subsample of 
#' 5000 online participants who participated
#' in a questionnaire available through the Open Source Psychometrics
#' Project (https://openpsychometrics.org/), an organization that maintains an 
#' open website for the public to take psychometric tests for 
#' educational and entertainment purposes
#' 
#' The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS) is a self-report
#' instrument for measuring depression, anxiety, and tension or stress. 
#' Each of 42 items falls into one of the three corresponding subscales.
#' 
#' Labels for DASS items in this dataset are denoted by the prefix 
#' "dass" and the suffix "_D", "_A", or "_S", indicating the depression,
#' anxiety, or stress subscale. 
#' 
#' Also includes demographics such as country, education level, 
#' rearing environment (urban/suburban/rural), gender, 
#' English as a native language, age, religion, sexual orientation, 
#' race, voting status, marriage status, and number of children 
#' in one's family during childhood.
