Description: Network trees recursively partition the data with respect to covariates. Two network tree algorithms are available: model-based trees based on a multivariate normal model and nonparametric trees based on covariance structures. After partitioning, correlation-based networks (psychometric networks) can be fit on the partitioned data. For details see Jones, Mair, Simon, & Zeileis (2020) <doi:10.1007/s11336-020-09731-4>.
